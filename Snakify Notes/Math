floor(x) — returns the largest integer less than or equal to x,

ceil(x) — returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to x,

sqrt(x) — returns the square root of x,

log(x) — returns the natural logarithm of x,

log(x,a) — returns the logarithm of x to base a,

pi is the mathematical constant pi = 3,1415926..

e — is the mathematical constant e = 2,71828..

sin(x) returns the sine of x in radians

cos(x) returns the cosine of x in radians

tan(x) returns the tangent function of x

asin(x) returns the arcsine of x in radians
# remember the rules:
# if you use "import math",
# you must call the desired function like
# math.sqrt(x)
# or
# math.cos(y)

# But if you use "from math import cos"
# this is how you call the function: 
# cos(x)
# Then, if you what to calculate a logarithm,
# you need to write "from math import log"
# and then you may call your logarithm
# with log(y) or log(z,10)
